# Neural network from scratch in C language

We propose here an implementration of a feed forward neural network from scratch.
The user can choose the parameters of the neural network (number of layers, number of neurons per layer). The implmentation is largely inspired by an old project in this [website](https://tdinfo.phelma.grenoble-inp.fr/1AS1/site/#cours/seances/#_top).

Please note that I did this personal project in 2020 as an exercise in C language and that the goal was not to gain in performance compared to specialized deep learning libraries/software (e.g. [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Pytoch](https://pytorch.org/). You may want use those instead in your problem. Nevertheless, it is always interesting and rewarding to rebuild things from scratch !
